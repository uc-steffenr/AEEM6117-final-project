# AEEM6117-final-project
Final project for AEEM 6117: Intelligent Robotics

## How To Install
Go to directory where `remi` was downloaded.

Install requirements. \
```pip install -r requirements.txt```

Install `remi`. \
```pip install -e .```

**Check out examples for usage.**

## TODO
- Need a widespread way to set controllers and events for `Simulation` conditions
- Should `r_s` and `r_t` be parameters that are changed for multiple simulations?
